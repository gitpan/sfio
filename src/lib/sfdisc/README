SFIO DISCIPLINES

IO discipline is a way for application to define filters that process data
input/output from/to a stream. See the sfio manual page for details on how to
insert disciplines into a stream.

Disciplines are reusable code, please contribute any interesting disciplines
that you come up with. Sharing reusable code means that the name space must
be managed. Therefore, I recommend that each discipline package provides
the following public interface:
	Sfdisc_t* sfdcnewXXX(arguments):
		Creates a discipline of the type XXX. For example, below is the
		function to create a discipline that duplicates output to a
		stream to another stream:
			dcnewtee(Sfio_t* tee)
	sfdcdelXXX(Sfdisc_t* disc):
		Frees the given discipline and any related resources.

This directory contains a number of example disciplines. Each source
file also contains a main() that is enable with the cpp's flag -DPROGRAM.
This lets you build a small program to try out the discipline.
