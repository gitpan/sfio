This directory contains the source of Sfio, the safe/fast I/O library.

There are a few subdirectories:

	Sfio_f:		function versions of sfio macros.
	Stdio_s:	the source level <stdio> compatibility package.
	Stdio_b:	the binary level <stdio> compatibility package.
	Sfio_t:		a set of regression tests - executed with "runtest".

There are two make files: Makefile for nmake and makefile for old make.

If you run into problems or have ideas for enhancement, please let me know.
Good luck and have fun.
