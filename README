This directory contains the following subdirectories:

	bin
	src/lib/sfdisc
	src/lib/sfio

You should change your shell PATH variable to include the subdirectory "bin".
This makes the program "iffe" available in your search path.
IFFE (IF Features Exist) is a language interpreter that probes
a local environment based on predefined specifications to determine various
features needed for proper configuration of a software. Iffe is pretty neat
and may be useful for you in writing self-configuring code. One or more example
iffe programs are in subdirectories "features" in the above subdirectories.
After changing PATH, you can go to the appropriate subdirectories and run "make".

Let me know of any problems. Good luck and have fun.
